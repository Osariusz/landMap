# papyrusMap
A Minecraft minimap mod unlike most others.
The main goal of this mod is to add a map that's not only showing you the terrain you explored but also of a big area that you've never visited, but it only shows if it is land or water.
It might be useful for example when searching for a ocean monuments or a place to build a pillager farm.
